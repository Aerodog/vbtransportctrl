CAUTION: IN-DEV SOFTWARE // May not function
=========================

This is a little plugin I made for The Voxel Box to control their "MetroVox" network. Vanilla minecart systems only work so well, but I discovered that they are a bit of a pain space-wise. I like to make subway systems, but the redstone required to make a proper subway system takes up too much space to stack rail lines.

The setup for the plugin is simple. All you need is a sign under a track with some key information (this is a stop):

===============
|  #railstop  |
|  [timeout]  |
| [direction] |
|    [y/n]    |
===============
       |
       |
       |

The timeout (integer) is the time in seconds a cart (with player onboard) will wait in a stop before continuing.
The direction is the (obviously) the direction of travel of the stop.
'Y' or 'N' (yes or no, respectively) determines if when the block under the control receives power a cart will be spawned on the track above the control sign.
